## Prompt

```
Goal: Create a complete Docusaurus book for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course and deploy it to GitHub Pages. The book must cover all four modules: ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA.
```

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course with the following key principles:

1. Comprehensive Educational Coverage - ensuring all four core modules are thoroughly covered
2. Progressive Learning Structure - building from fundamentals to advanced implementations
3. Practical Implementation Focus - all concepts must have working code examples
4. Integration and Interoperability - emphasizing how different technologies work together
5. Documentation and Accessibility - clear explanations and step-by-step instructions
6. Open Source and Reproducibility - all materials must be open source and replicable

The constitution also includes technology stack requirements, quality standards, development workflow, and governance guidelines.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created foundational constitution document for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course project
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with project-specific constitution
- 🔁 Next prompts: Plan the Docusaurus book structure and module content
- 🧠 Reflection: The constitution establishes clear educational principles and technology requirements for the course

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create the Docusaurus book structure based on the constitution
