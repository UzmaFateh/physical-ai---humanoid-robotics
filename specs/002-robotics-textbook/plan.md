# Implementation Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Branch**: `002-robotics-textbook` | **Date**: 2025-12-07 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/002-robotics-textbook/spec.md`

**Note**: This plan was generated by the `/sp.plan` command.

## Summary

This plan outlines the creation of a complete, text-only textbook for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course. The project will be built using Docusaurus, ensuring a modern, accessible, and maintainable web-based format. The content is structured into four distinct modules as required by the specification: ROS 2, Digital Twins, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems. All code examples and lab exercises are designed to be compatible with ROS 2 Humble and the NVIDIA Jetson Orin platform, providing a stable and reproducible learning environment for students.

## Technical Context

The technical stack was determined based on the feature specification and further refined in `research.md`.

**Language/Version**: 
  - **Content**: Markdown (MDX via Docusaurus)
  - **Code Examples**: Python 3.10 (`rclpy` for ROS 2)
  - **Platform**: ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill

**Primary Dependencies**: 
  - **Website**: Docusaurus v3
  - **Simulation**: Gazebo Classic 11, Unity (with ROS TCP Connector v0.7.0)
  - **AI & Perception**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim `2023.1.1`, NVIDIA Isaac ROS `2.0.0`
  - **VLA**: OpenAI Whisper API, OpenAI GPT-4/3.5-Turbo API

**Storage**: The project consists of flat files (Markdown) managed in a Git repository. No database is required.

**Testing**: 
  - Docusaurus website builds successfully (`yarn build`).
  - All code examples are manually tested for execution on the target platform.
  - Lab exercises are validated to ensure they are solvable and meet learning objectives.

**Target Platform**: 
  - **Textbook Access**: Any modern web browser.
  - **Code Execution**: NVIDIA Jetson Orin with JetPack 5.1.2, or a comparable Linux system with an NVIDIA GPU.

**Project Type**: Documentation / Static Website.

**Constraints**: The textbook must be text-only, with no diagrams or images, as per the feature specification.

**Scale/Scope**: Approximately 16 chapters across 4 modules, aimed at AI/CS students.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

The project's `constitution.md` is currently a template. Assuming standard principles of simplicity, maintainability, and clear documentation, this plan is in compliance. The choice of Docusaurus and Markdown aligns with simplicity and maintainability. All design artifacts (`research.md`, `data-model.md`) are created to ensure clarity.

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

The design artifacts for this feature are organized as follows:

```text
specs/002-robotics-textbook/
├── plan.md              # This file
├── research.md          # Key technical decisions
├── data-model.md        # Defines the content structure
├── quickstart.md        # Environment setup guide
└── tasks.md             # To be generated by /sp.tasks
```

### Source Code (repository root)

The source code for the textbook will follow a standard Docusaurus project structure.

```

**Structure Decision**: A standard Docusaurus project structure was chosen. Content is separated into the `docs/` directory, organized by module. All code examples will be stored centrally in `src/code-examples` to keep them separate from the prose and facilitate testing.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitutional violations were identified that require justification.
