# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Comprehensive Educational Coverage
Course content must comprehensively cover all four core modules: ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity Digital Twin, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems. Each module should include theoretical foundations, practical implementation, and hands-on exercises.

### II. Progressive Learning Structure
Content must follow a progressive learning approach, building from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations. Each module should have clear prerequisites and learning objectives that build upon previous knowledge.

### III. Practical Implementation Focus (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All theoretical concepts must be accompanied by practical code examples, simulations, and real-world applications. Students must be able to implement, test, and validate each concept covered in the course.

### IV. Integration and Interoperability
The course must emphasize how different robotics frameworks and technologies integrate. Students should understand how ROS 2 communicates with simulation environments, how NVIDIA Isaac connects with perception systems, and how VLA models interact with robotic platforms.

### V. Documentation and Accessibility
All code examples, configurations, and procedures must be thoroughly documented with clear explanations, diagrams, and step-by-step instructions. The course must be accessible to students with varying technical backgrounds.

### VI. Open Source and Reproducibility
All course materials, code examples, and configurations must be open source and reproducible. Students should be able to replicate all examples using publicly available tools and resources.

## Course Standards

### Technology Stack Requirements
- ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill or later) for robotics middleware
- Gazebo and Unity for simulation environments
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim and ROS for perception and control
- Python and C++ for implementation examples
- Docusaurus for documentation and course delivery
- GitHub Pages for deployment and accessibility

### Quality Standards
- All code examples must be tested and verified
- Documentation must include setup instructions, dependencies, and troubleshooting guides
- Course content must be updated to reflect current best practices and version compatibility
- All examples must work in both simulation and real hardware contexts where applicable

## Development Workflow

### Content Creation Process
- All course content follows a spec-driven approach with clear learning objectives
- Code examples are developed and tested before documentation
- Content is reviewed by domain experts before publication
- Student feedback is incorporated through structured review cycles

### Review and Quality Assurance
- All new content must include working code examples
- Documentation must be verified by independent reviewers
- Course materials must be tested across different operating systems
- Performance benchmarks and expected outcomes must be clearly defined

## Governance

Course governance follows the Spec-Driven Development methodology where all changes must:
- Maintain alignment with core educational objectives
- Preserve backward compatibility for existing students
- Include comprehensive testing of all new features
- Document any breaking changes with migration paths
